## Introduction

This specification describes the mapping of car-sharing provider [deer](https://www.deer-carsharing.de/)'s API to GBFS.

deer GmbH uses Fleetster as booking service provider. Besides the standard Fleetster API, deer defines a
couple of custom properties, that should e taken into account when mapping to GBFS.

## General Information

This section gives a high level overview of the sharing provider's API and the defined mapping to GBFS.

The Fleetster API is described via a [Swagger API documentation](https://my.fleetster.net/swagger/).

## Open Issues or Questions

Open questions are now managed as [issues](https://github.com/mobidata-bw/x2gbfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adeer). They should be tagged with `deer`.


## Files

### gbfs.json

Standard file, feed will be provided in feed language `de` only.

### gbfs_versions.json

Optional file, will not be provided. Only GBFSv2.3 supported.

### system_information.json

System information is manually extracted from the providers homepage. Only the real configuration in [config/deer.json](config/deer.json) is relevant.

Note: According to fleetster/deer, currently no rental_app uri's exist.


### vehicle_types.json

fleetster API has no explicit endpoint for vehicle types, so the need to be collected from vehicle’s information.
The vehicles endpoint returns an array, each element is a vehicle, only vehicles meeting the following conditions are considered:

* `vehicle['active'] is True`
* `vehicle['deleted'] is False`
* `vehicle['typeOfUsage'] == 'carsharing'`
* station with ID `vehicle['locationId']` is a valid carsharing station (see station_information)

#### Field Mappings

`cargo_volume_capacity` | -
`cargo_load_capacity` | -
`propulsion_type` | vehicle[‘engine’]<br /><br /><ul><li>`electric => electric`</li></ul>Others currently not in use. Converter should report an error if not and ignore this vehicle.
`eco_label` | -
`max_range_meters` | Not provided by fleetster/deer. Set to `200000` for all vehicle types (200km)
`name` | normalized vehicle['brand'] + normalized vehicle['model']

### station_information.json

JSON response for `/locations` contains array, each representing a station. Only those with the following attributes will be considered:

* `location['deleted'] is False`
* `location['extended']['PublicCarsharing']['hasPublicCarsharing'] is True`

#### Field Mappings

`rental_uris` | No information available


### station_status.json

Returns all stations of `/locations` endpoint, criteria see above (station_information.json)

#### Field Mappings

GBFS Field | Mapping
--- | ---
`station_id` | `location['id']`
`num_bikes_available` | no need to provide, will be deduced from `x2gbfs` via vehicles' stationIds and availability
`vehicle_types_available` | no need to provide, will be deduced from `x2gbfs` via vehicles' stationIds and availability
`num_bikes_disabled` | -
`num_docks_available` | -
`vehicle_docks_available` | -
`num_docks_disabled` | -
`is_installed` | `true`
`is_renting` | `true`
`is_returning` | `true`
`last_reported` | Not part of API. Setting to current timestamp.


### free_bike_status.json

Returns all vehicles of `/vehicles` endpoint, filtering criteria see above (vehicle_types.json).

#### Field Mappings

GBFS Field | Mapping
--- | ---
`bike_id` |  `vehicle['_id']`
`lat` |  -
`lon` |  -
`is_reserved` | `False`, if bookings request does not return any booking having startDate < now < endDate for this vehicle, else true (see also `available_until`)
`is_disabled` | -
`rental_uris` | None. fleetster/deer do not provide rental uris for now
`vehicle_type_id` | normalized, lower cased `vehicle['brand']` + '_' + normalized, lower cased `vehicle['model']`
`last_reported` |
`current_range_meters` | Hard coded to `50000` (50km) as no realtime info is available
`current_fuel_percent` | -
`station_id` | `vehicle['locationId']`
`home_station_id` | -
`pricing_plan_id` | -
`vehicle_equipment` | `winter_tires` if `extended.Properties.winterTires`
`available_until` | `/bookings?endDate%5B%24gte%5D={now}Z` returns all bookings ending in the future. If there is no booking for this vehicle (`vehicleId == booking['vehicleId']`) which has already started (`bookings['startDate'] < now`) ), available_until is the earliest booking's `bookings['startDate']`. Unset else.


### system_hours.json

Not provided for now. system_hours would describe the whole system, not opening_hours per station.


### system_calendar.json

Not provided for now.


### system_regions.json

Not provided for now.


### system_pricing_plans.json

### geofencing_zones.json

Not provided for now.


## Deep Links

This sections describes how Deep Links can be costructed from `station_id` or `vehicle_id`.

Currently, no deeplinks for deer are provided.
