# x2gbfs

x2gbfs is a library, which generates GBFS feed's from various providers.

Currently supported providers:

* deer (via it's fleetster API)
* VOI Karlsruhe (via Raumobil API)
* various Stadtmobil/Teilauto providers (via Cantamen IXSI API)
* various MOQO based providers (e.g. Stadtwerke Tauberfranken)
* various cargo bike systems of Herrenberg city, provided in a static, lightweight json close to GBFS ("[gbfs-light](https://oda-git-jens-ox-gbfs-light-jens-ochsenmeiers-projects.vercel.app/schema/gbfs-light)")
* DB Flinkster
* Free2move
* Cambio Aachen (via Cambio API)
* Lastenvelo Freiburg (via custom CSV, provider id: `lastenvelo_fr`)
* AlpsGo! (provider id: `opendatahub`) via NOI's OpenDataHub


To generate a feed for e.g. deer network, switch to the `x2gbfs` project base dir and execute

```sh
DEER_API_URL=URL DEER_USER=USER DEER_PASSWORD=PASSWORD python -m x2gbfs.x2gbfs -p deer -b 'file:out'
```

where `URL`, `USER` and `PASSWORD` needs to be replaced by the fleetster API credentials. 
If the GBFS has been generated successfully, this will result in the following output:

```
INFO:x2gbfs:Updated feeds for deer
```

Alternatively, the `DEER_API_URL`, `DEER_USER` and `DEER_PASSWORD` vars can be provided via an `.env` file in the current dir, which will be picked up by `x2gbfs`. See [.env.example](.env.example) fas an example.


Note: Usually, not every GBFS information can be retrieved from the provider's API. 
The content of `system_information` and `system_pricing_plans` currently needs to 
be provided via config/<provider>.json and needs to be updated when that information changes.

## Available providers

Currently, more than 20 providers are supported. For details, see the current state in folder [config/](https://github.com/mobidata-bw/x2gbfs/tree/main/config)


### deer (Fleetster)

To generate the deer GBFS feed, you need to provide the following environment variables:

* `DEER_API_URL=https://deer.fleetster.de`
* `DEER_USER=<your username>`
* `DEER_PASSWORD=<your password>`

For details, see the [mapping documentation](./docs/mappings/deer_gbfs_2.3_mapping.md).


### Lastenvelo Freiburg (Custom)

Lastenvelo Freiburg publishes a regularly updated [CSV file](https://www.lastenvelofreiburg.de/LVF_usage.csv). No credentials are required.

For details, see the [mapping documentation](./docs/mappings/lastenvelo_fr_gbfs_2.3_mapping.md).


### Various Stadtmobil agencies and my-e-car (Cantamen)

To generate the stadtmobil_suedbaden, stadtmobil_stuttgart and my-e-car GBFS feed, you need to provide the following environment variables:

* `CANTAMEN_IXSI_API_URL=https://url.de`

Note: the Cantamen IXSI service is IP restricted.

For details, see the [mapping documentation](./docs/mappings/ixsi_gbfs_2.3_mapping.md).


### Cambio

Cambio provides publicly available static feeds for the cities they provide their service in.
Currently, only `cambio_aachen` is available. To extend `x2gbfs` for other cambio cities,
copy the config/cambio_aachen config and adapt accordingly.

Note that the pricing plans don't reflect the various available tarifs.

Note also, that Cambio asks users to only request their information
once per 24 hours. To reflect this in the generated GBFS, it uses a
[`ttl` of `86400`](https://github.com/mobidata-bw/x2gbfs/blob/main/config/cambio_aachen.json#L89-91) which deviates from x2gbfs' default value (60).

For details, see the [mapping documentation](./docs/mappings/cambio_gbfs_2.3_mapping.md).

 
### AlpsGo!

Converts NOI's OpenDataHub carsharing feed to GBFS.



### Stadtwerk Tauberfranken (MOQO)

To generate the Stadtwerk Tauberfranken GBFS feed, you need to provide the following environment variable:

* `MOQO_API_TOKEN=<MOQO Token>`

For details, see the [mapping documentation](./docs/mappings/moqo_gbfs_2.3_mapping.md).

### Flinkster (DB-Connect)

To generate the Flinkster GBFS feed, you need to provide the following environment variables:

* `FLINKSTER_CLIENT_ID=<FLINKSTER_CLIENT_ID>`
* `FLINKSTER_SECRET=<FLINKSTER_SECRET>`

For details, see the [mapping documentation](./docs/mappings/flinkster_gbfs_2.3_mapping.md).

### Free2move

To generate a GBFS feed for a Free2move location, you need to provide the following environment variables:

* `FREE2MOVE_BASE_URL=<FREE2MOVE_BASE_URL>`
* `FREE2MOVE_USER=<FREE2MOVE_USER>`
* `FREE2MOVE_PASSWORD=<FREE2MOVE_PASSWORD>`

Besides this, a CACHE_DIR env variable must be provided, which is used to store the last retrieved vehicles information, so only delta updates need to be requested.

Note that Free2move is a feed that contains GDPR relevant vehicle
information (the vehicle Id of free floating vehicles is not rotated by
free2move after rentals). This feed should not be made publicly
available.
For this reason, property `x2gbfs/useCustomBaseUrl` is set to `true`. When
`x2gbfs` is started with param  `--customBaseUrl` (shorthand `-r`),
this base URL is used in gbfs.json. The service under this URL should be access protected.

For details, see the [mapping documentation](./docs/mappings/free2move_gbfs_2.3_mapping.md).


## Implementing a new provider
To implement a new provider, you should take the following steps:

* Implement a new `BaseProvider` subclass, which retrieves `station_info`, `station_status` (in case it's a station based system), `vehicles` and `vehicle_types` from the provides API.
* Provide a `config/my_new_provider.json` which contains a `feed_data` section that provides the seldomly updated `system_information` and `pricing_plans`.
* Add the newly created provider to `x2gbfs.py`'s `build_extractor` method.

Note that you should regularly check, if system or pricing information has changed and needs to be updated. 
To take notice of such changes, you might register a watch on the relevant urls of the provider website.

As an example, how a free floating provider could be implemented, see the [example provider](./x2gbfs/providers/example.py).

## Using Docker

The following command demonstrates how to run x2gbfs in a Docker container which
- only generates the `deer` GBFS feed (`-p deer`),
- writes into a directory that is mounted from the host machine (`-v â€¦`),
- has access to the necessary Deer API credentials (`--env-file .env`),
- runs indefinetly and updates all feeds every n seconds (`-i 60 or -i 3600`).

```sh
docker build -t x2gbfs .
# For dynamic feeds, update every 60 seconds (-i 60)
docker run --rm -v $PWD/out:/app/out --env-file .env x2gbfs -p deer,voi-raumobil,lastenvelo_fr,flinkster -b 'file:out' -i 60
# For static feeds, an update every hour (3600 seconds) should be sufficient (-i 3600)
docker run --rm -v $PWD/out:/app/out --env-file .env x2gbfs -p my-e-car,stadmobil_suedbaden -b 'file:out' -i 3600

```
